def depthFirstTreeSearch(problem):

    Search the deepest nodes in the search tree first.

    Your search algorithm needs to return a list of actions that reaches the
    goal.

    To get started, you might want to try some of these simple commands to
    understand the search problem that is being passed in:

    print "Start:", problem.getStartState()
    print "Is the start a goal?", problem.isGoalState(problem.getStartState())
    print "Start's successors:", problem.getSuccessors(problem.getStartState())

    problem.getStartState(): returns a pair (tuple of size 2) that represents
    the coordinate of where the pacman starts

    problem.isGoalState((x, y)): returns a boolean True/False based on whether
    the coordinate (x, y) is a goal state.

    problem.getSuccessors((x, y)): given a position (x, y), returns a list of
    triples (list of tuples, with each tuple being size 3) of the successor
    positions of pacman.
    The tuple consists of position, action required to get to it, and the step
    cost i.e. ((35,2), 'North', 1).

    Remember to use the data structures in util.py: Stack, Queue, or
    PriorityQueue

    Remember to process the list of successors as a batch for the current state.

    For the search functions, you are required to return a list of actions
    (that is, a list of strings such as ['North', 'North', 'West'])
